This structure is less dense than liquid water, which is why ice floats.\n\n3. **Phase Transition:**  \n   The process of freezing occurs at 0°C, where liquid water and solid ice coexist. As heat continues to be removed, more water molecules join the solid lattice, and the proportion of ice increases.\n\n4. **Energy Release (Latent Heat of Fusion):**  \n   During freezing, the water releases a certain amount of energy to its surroundings, called the *latent heat of fusion*. This energy must be removed for all the water to solidify.\n\n5. **Solid State (Ice):**  \n   Below 0°C, assuming normal pressure, the water exists as solid ice. The colder it gets, the less molecular movement there is within the ice, though it still vibrates slightly.\n\nIn summary, below 0°C, water transitions from a liquid to a solid state, forming ice due to the slowdown and organization of its molecules into a crystalline structure",

This is also the reason ice floats on water.\n\n2. **Latent Heat of Fusion**: Even after the water reaches 0°C, it won't immediately turn into ice. Heat energy (latent heat of fusion) must be removed to complete the phase transition from liquid to solid.

It can lead to inefficiencies or unintended consequences:\n  - **Performance issues**: Fetching all columns may return more data than needed, leading to higher memory usage and slower performance, especially with large tables.\n  - **Unexpected changes**: If the table structure changes (e.g., new columns are added), queries using `SELECT *` may start returning unexpected results.\n- Instead, it is often better to explicitly list the columns you need:\n  ```sql\n  SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees;\n  ```\n\nThis approach is more efficient and makes the query more readable and maintainable.",

Here is a clear and concise explanation of what `SELECT *` does in SQL.\n\n### The Short Answer\n\n`SELECT *` is a SQL command that retrieves **all columns** from a specified table.\n\n---\n\n### The Detailed Explanation\n\nThink of a database table as a spreadsheet with rows and columns. The `SELECT` statement is used to query (ask for) data from that table.\n\n*   The asterisk `*` is a **wildcard** that stands for \"every column.\"\n*   So, `SELECT *` essentially tells the database: **\"Give me every piece of data from every column for the rows that match my criteria.\"**\n\n#### Basic Syntax:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM table_name;\n```\nThis will return a result set with all rows and every column from `table_name`.\n\n#### Example with a WHERE clause:\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';\n```\nThis returns all columns, but only for the rows where the `country` column has the value 'USA'.\n\n### Key Points to Remember:\n\n1.  **Convenience vs. Efficiency:** It's very convenient for quick data exploration or when you genuinely need to see all columns. However, for production code or applications, it is **considered a bad practice**. You should explicitly list the columns you need (e.g., `SELECT first_name, email FROM customers;`).

Here are the key milestones:\n\n*   **1993:** A group of scientists (Charles H. Bennett, Gilles Brassard, Claude Crépeau, Richard Jozsa, Asher Peres, and William K.

Below 0°C, the molecules start to arrange themselves into a more structured, hexagonal lattice due to hydrogen bonding.\n\n2. **Formation of Ice**: At 0°C, water begins to freeze under standard atmospheric pressure. The molecules lock into a crystalline structure, which is less dense than liquid water. This is why ice floats on water—an unusual property compared to most substances, where the solid form is denser than the liquid.\n\n3. **Expansion**: As water freezes, it expands by about 9% in volume. This expansion occurs because the open hexagonal structure of ice takes up more space than the more compact arrangement of liquid water molecules.\n\n4. **Complete Freezing**: If the temperature continues to drop and remains below 0°C, the water will fully solidify into ice. The exact freezing process can be influenced by factors such as pressure, impurities, or the presence of nucleation sites (tiny particles or surfaces that help initiate freezing).\n\n5. **Exceptions**: Under certain conditions, water may not freeze at 0°C.

Key implications include:\n\n1. **Automation of Tasks** – AI will take over repetitive, routine, or data-heavy tasks, increasing efficiency but potentially displacing some jobs.\n2. **New Job Creation** – While some roles may decline, AI will generate demand for new skills (e.g., AI training, ethics, maintenance) and hybrid roles.\n3. **Enhanced Productivity** – Workers will leverage AI tools to augment decision-making, creativity, and problem-solving.\n4. **Workforce Shifts** – Industries may see restructuring, with a greater focus on human-AI collaboration, upskilling, and adaptability.\n5. **Ethical & Social Challenges** – Issues like bias, job displacement, and privacy will require policy and organizational adjustments.\n\nIn short, AI won’t just replace work—it will redefine it, requiring proactive adaptation from individuals, businesses, and governments.",
