However, scientists have successfully teleported subatomic particles.

This is because:\n\n* It improves query performance by reducing the amount of data being retrieved and processed.\n* It makes your code more readable and maintainable by explicitly stating the required columns.\n* It helps prevent issues when the table schema changes (e.g., new columns are added or existing ones are removed).\n\nFor example, instead of using `SELECT *`, you can specify the columns you need:\n\n```sql\nSELECT id, name, age FROM employees;\n```",
