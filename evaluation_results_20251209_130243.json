Unlike most substances that contract when they solidify, ice is less dense than liquid water, which is why ice floats.\n\n2. **Molecular Structure**: In liquid water, the molecules are in constant motion, while in solid ice, the molecules are fixed in place within a rigid structure. The hydrogen bonds become more stable and organized, leading to the formation of the hexagonal lattice structure characteristic of ice.\n\n3. **Release of Heat**: As water freezes, it releases latent heat, known as the heat of fusion. This is the energy released when water transitions from liquid to solid without a change in temperature.\n\n4. **Effects of Pressure**: The freezing point of water can be affected by pressure. At higher pressures, the freezing point can be lowered, while at lower pressures, it may rise slightly.\n\nOverall, when water's temperature drops below 0°C, it undergoes a fundamental change in physical state, becoming solid ice with unique properties.",

The results will include every attribute of each record in that table.\n\n**Key Points:**\n- **All Columns**: `SELECT *` returns all columns defined in the specified table.\n- **All Rows**: It returns all rows unless a `WHERE` clause is specified to filter the data.\n- **Simplicity & Convenience**: It's a quick way to fetch complete data without having to list out each column name.\n- **Performance Consideration**: While convenient for quick queries or small datasets, using `SELECT *` can lead to performance issues, especially on large tables, because it retrieves more data than necessary.

Common use cases for lambda functions include passing a simple function as an argument to higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.\n\nHere's an example of a lambda function:\n\n```python\n# A simple lambda function that adds two numbers\nadd = lambda x, y: x + y\n\n# Using the lambda function\nresult = add(5, 3)\nprint(result)  # Output: 8\n```\n\nAnd here’s an example of using a lambda function with `sorted()`:\n\n```python\n# Sorting a list of tuples based on the second element\ndata = [(1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 0)]\nsorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])\nprint(sorted_data)  # Output: [(5, 0),",

This state is called **supercooled water**.

You can have zero or more arguments, separated by commas.\n- **`expression`**: A single expression that gets evaluated and returned.

This is because the molecular structure of ice is less dense than liquid water, which is why ice floats on water.\n\n4. **Pressure Effects**: The freezing point of water can also change under different pressures. Higher pressure can lower the freezing point, which is why ice can melt under pressure (like under the blade of an ice skate).\n\nSo, under normal conditions, water will freeze into ice at 0°C, but factors like impurities, pressure, and disturbances can affect this process.",

Quantum teleportation is a process by which the quantum state of a particle is transferred from one location to another without physically moving the particle itself. This was first successfully demonstrated in 1997 by a team of physicists led by Anton Zeilinger at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. They teleported the quantum state of a photon over a short distance. While this is a groundbreaking achievement, it does not involve the teleportation of a physical person or object.\n\nIn popular culture, the idea of human teleportation often traces back to fictional works. One of the earliest notable references is in the 1877 story *The Man Without a Body* by Edward Page Mitchell, where a scientist teleports a cat (with unintended consequences). Later, teleportation became iconic with the \"transporter\" technology in *Star Trek*, first aired in 1966.\n\nIf you're asking about a specific fictional character or a cultural reference, please clarify! As for real-world history, no individual has teleported, and the concept remains speculative outside of quantum experiments.",

This is the most important measure for algorithm analysis.\n\n### Why O(log n)?\n\nThe key is understanding how many steps (iterations) it takes. The algorithm halves the searchable portion with each step.\n\n*   After 1 step, `n/2` elements remain.\n*   After 2 steps, `n/4` (or `n/2²`) elements remain.\n*   After `k` steps, `n/2ᵏ` elements remain.\n\nThe search stops when only 1 element remains (in the worst case):\n`n/2",

It cannot contain statements like `if`, `for`, `while`, `return`, or `=` (assignment).\n3.  **Inline:** It's typically used for short, simple operations that are needed for a short period, often passed as an argument to another function.\n\n---\n\n### Syntax\n\nThe syntax is very compact:\n```python\nlambda arguments: expression\n```\n\n*   `lambda`: The keyword that defines it.\n*   `arguments`: The input parameters (like the names inside the parentheses of a `def` function). You can have any number of arguments, separated by commas.\n*   `expression`: The single operation the function performs. The result of this expression is automatically returned. There is no `return` statement.\n\n---\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Example 1: A Simple Addition Function\nCompare a regular function with a lambda:\n\n**Regular Function (`def`):**\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x",

However, he used it in the context of strange disappearances and appearances, not as a technological process.\n\nThe idea of a person being deliberately teleported first appeared in **Edward Page Mitchell**'s 1877 short story *The Man Without a Body*, in which a scientist invents a machine to disassemble and reassemble a cat and then himself (with disastrous results).\n\nA more famous early example is in **George Langelaan**'s 1957 short story *The Fly*, which was later adapted into iconic films.\n\n### In Real-World Science\n\nNo human has ever been teleported. However, scientists have successfully teleported subatomic particles. This is achieved through a quantum phenomenon called **quantum teleportation**.\n\nThe first successful teleportation of a quantum state (a photon, or particle of light) was achieved by a team of scientists led by **Anton Zeilinger** in 1997 at the University of Innsbruck.
